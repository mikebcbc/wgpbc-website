                                    Why, seeing that we enjoy the comforts of
                                    modern living, do we identify ourselves as

                                    <strong>
                                        As a church, we make a sincere effort to

                                    </strong>
                                    Therefore, we are &quot;primitive&quot;,
                                    meaning first or original.

                                    But our message? The message from the
                                    Primitive Baptist pulpits all over America
                                    is as up-to-date as the morning newspaper.
                                    What could be more current than to hear of a
                                    sovereign God who is infinitely concerned
                                    for the welfare of his people? His interest
                                    is so great that He gave Jesus Christ, His
                                    only begotten Son, as the sin bearer that
                                    all His family might safely live with God
                                    after life on earth has ended. But
                                    that&apos;s not the end of the message. Not
                                    only did God make arrangements for His
                                    family to live in Heaven, God provides daily
                                    guidance for His servants as they face the
                                    choices, decisions, trials, and conflicts of
                                    life. Learning how to make the right choices
                                    - the ones that will honor God - is a
                                    principle part of Christian activity.
                                    Therefore much is heard from our ministers
                                    about godly daily living.

                                    We feel that you might find a Bible-based
                                    worship service among the Primitive Baptists
                                    refreshing. Sometimes the hectic machinery
                                    of modern religion detracts from the simple,
                                    but central message of &quot;Jesus Christ
                                    and Him crucified.&quot; Therefore, we
                                    invite you to experience the thrill of
                                    stepping into a time tunnel, walking in
                                    &quot;the old paths&quot;, and worshipping
                                    in a manner that is 2000 years old.

                                        the commands of God, are well pleasing
                                        in His sight and should be maintained;
                                        but they are to be considered only as
                                        evidence of a gracious state, and are
                                        not a condition of eternal salvation.
